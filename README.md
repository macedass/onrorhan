Here's a catchy GitHub Pages bio introduction for a fresh game data analyst:

🎮 Game Data Analyst | Turning Pixels into Insights | Leveling Up Player Experiences 🕹️

Hi there! I'm Onur, a passionate game data analyst fresh out of the spawn point and ready to crunch numbers, slay ambiguity, and unlock the secrets hidden in player behavior. Armed with SQL queries, Python scripts, and a love for gaming, I bridge the gap between raw metrics and unforgettable gameplay.

My Quest:

🔍 Mining player telemetry to optimize game design & retention

📈 Transforming spreadsheets into stories with Tableau/PowerBI

🎯 Predicting player churn like a final boss battle

🛠️ Building dashboards that even non-dev NPCs would high-five

Whether it’s analyzing loot box economies, balancing difficulty curves, or decoding rage-quit patterns, I thrive where data meets dopamine. Currently sharpening my skills in BigQuery, Pyton and building projects that prove data can be as fun as a speedrun.

Let’s Press Start:
Check out my repositories for SQL sorcery, Python power-ups, and dashboards that turn “game over” into “game optimized.” New game+ mode: Always open to collab on indie projects!

📊 Stats: SQL | Python/R | Tableau | Game Analytics Engines | A/B Testing
🎮 Favorite Power-Up: Caffeine + curiosity

Ready Player One? Let’s connect and design games that players never want to quit. 🚀
